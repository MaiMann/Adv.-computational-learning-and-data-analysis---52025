These operations allow you to manipulate, analyze, and transform tensors in various ways. Here's a breakdown of some common categories:\n","\n","1. Arithmetic Operations:\n","\n","These operations perform element-wise calculations between tensors or a tensor and a scalar value. They include:\n","\n","    Addition (+)\n","    Subtraction (-)\n","    Multiplication (*)\n","    Division (/)\n","    Exponentiation (**)\n","\n","These operations can be used for simple calculations or combined to create more complex expressions.\n","\n","2. Comparison Operations:\n","\n","These operations compare elements between tensors or a tensor and a scalar value, resulting in a tensor of booleans (True or False) indicating the comparison outcome. Examples include:\n","\n","    Equal (==)\n","    Not equal (!=)\n","    Greater than (>)\n","    Less than (<)\n","    Greater than or equal (>=)\n","    Less than or equal (<=)\n","\n","Comparison operations are useful for filtering data or making decisions within your model.\n","\n","3. Broadcasting:\n","\n","A powerful feature in PyTorch, broadcasting allows operations between tensors of different shapes as long as they are compatible. For instance, you can add a scalar value to a tensor, or add a one-dimensional tensor to a two-dimensional tensor (as long as the dimensions match). PyTorch automatically expands the smaller tensor to match the larger one for element-wise operations.\n","\n","4. In-place Operations:\n","\n","Certain operations modify the original tensor they are applied to, denoted by a trailing underscore (_). Examples include:\n","\n","    x.add_(y) (equivalent to x = x + y)\n","    x.sub_(y) (equivalent to x = x - y)\n","    x.mul_(y) (equivalent to x = x * y)\n","\n","These operations can be memory-efficient when modifying existing tensors is desired.\n","\n","5. Linear Algebra Operations:\n","\n","PyTorch provides functions for common linear algebra operations on tensors, including:\n","\n","    torch.matmul(a, b): Matrix multiplication between tensors a and b.\n","    torch.sum(input, dim=None): Sums the elements of a tensor along a specified dimension.\n","    torch.mean(input, dim=None): Computes the mean of the elements of a tensor along a specified dimension.\n","\n","These operations are essential for various deep learning tasks like calculating activation outputs or loss functions.\n","\n","6. Tensor Reshaping and Indexing:\n","\n","PyTorch offers functionalities to manipulate the shape and access specific elements of tensors:\n","\n","    x.view(new_shape): Reshapes the tensor x into a new shape while keeping the total number of elements the same.\n","    x[index]: Accesses specific elements or sub-tensors using indexing syntax (similar to NumPy).\n","\n","Reshaping and indexing are crucial for preparing data for specific layers in your neural network architecture.\n","\n","7. Element-wise Operations:\n","\n","These operations apply a function to each element of a tensor independently. PyTorch provides a rich set of element-wise functions like:\n","\n","    torch.relu(x): Applies the rectified linear unit (ReLU) activation function.\n","    torch.sigmoid(x): Applies the sigmoid activation function.\n","    torch.tanh(x): Applies the hyperbolic tangent (tanh) activation function.\n","\n","Element-wise operations are fundamental for introducing non-linearity and transforming data in deep learning models.\n","\n","8. Random Operations:\n","\n","PyTorch offers functions for generating random tensors or modifying existing ones with randomness:\n","\n","    torch.rand(shape): Generates a random tensor filled with uniformly distributed values between 0 and 1.\n","    torch.randn(shape): Generates a random tensor filled with values from a standard normal distribution.\n","\n","These operations are useful for data augmentation techniques or initializing weights in your network.\n","\n","By understanding and effectively using these PyTorch tensor operations, you can build and manipulate your deep learning
